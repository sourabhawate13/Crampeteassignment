		<p>If you have an active Individual Membership and purchase another one, the new subscription term will be added to the time remaining on your current term.
		For example, if you have 35 days remaining on your Individual Membership and buy a 365-day Individual Membership, your remaining subscription term will now be 400 days. You can add Individual Memberships up to a total term of three years.
		Note that you cannot combine Family Memberships and Individual Memberships</p>

		<p>You can purchase a Family Membership and set it for automatic renewal even if you have an active Individual Membership. This will turn off automatic renewal for your Individual Membership.
	     However, your subscription terms won't be combined; your Individual Membership will remain active until the end of its term</p>

		<p>Individual Memberships allow one Nintendo Account holder access to the Nintendo Switch Online service. They are available in 	1-month, 3-month, and 12-month increments.
			Family Memberships give up to eight Nintendo Account holders access to the Nintendo Switch Online service for a 12-month period.
			If you have more than one person to share the plan with, you can save on the total cost of the annual membership per person.  The more people in your family group, the more you’ll save.
			As the purchaser of a Family Membership, you will need to be at least 18 years old and save your credit card or link your PayPal account to your Nintendo Account via Nintendo eShop.</p>
